1. INTRODUCTION

These tools are intended for creating a program that can be interfaced via a web browser that supports javascript.
Once created, the program must run on a computer that also runs a http server (such as Apache).

For the program to be interfaced, a webpage is required. The webpage implements, through javascript and CGI, the
communication with the program.

2. COMPILATION OF THE DEMO

To compile the demo, uncompress the tar and do the following in a terminal:

cp -r app /var/www/ 

cd myProject
make clean
make webSysLib
make all
cp ../webSysDemo /usr/lib/cgi-bin
cp ../webSysBinaries/webSysClient.cgi /usr/lib/cgi-bin
cp ../webSysBinaries/webSys.conf /usr/lib/cgi-bin

3. USAGE

First, edit /usr/lib/cgi-bin/webSys.conf so it points to the right files.
Then, in a terminal:

cd /usr/lib/cgi-bin
./webSysDemo &

(At this stage, if you do in a terminal

more var/www/yourPathToTheFile/sensors01.json

you should see the data changing.)

Open a web browser (Chrome) and go to http://localhost/app/index.html
